# Contributing to IronCore

Welcome to the IronCore contributor guide! Whether you're fixing a typo, reporting a bug, or building a new feature,
your contributions are welcome at any time. This guide applies to all repositories under the
[ironcore-dev](https://github.com/ironcore-dev) GitHub organization.

## Prerequisites

Before your first contribution, please complete the following:

1. **Create a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup)** if you don't already have one.
2. **Sign the [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/)** — all commits must be
   signed off (`git commit -s`) to certify that you wrote the code or have the right to submit it. This is checked
   automatically on every pull request.
3. **Read our [Code of Conduct](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/about/code-of-conduct/)** — we follow the
   Linux Foundation Code of Conduct and are committed to providing a welcoming and respectful community for everyone.

## Find Something to Work On

Not sure where to start? Here are a few ways to find your first contribution:

- **Browse [`good first issue`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aironcore-dev+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22+state%3Aopen&type=issues)
  labels** — these are issues where maintainers have committed to providing extra guidance.
- **Look for [`help wanted`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aironcore-dev+label%3A%22help+wanted%22+state%3Aopen&type=issues)
  labels** — these are issues open for community contribution.
- **Improve documentation** — clarify existing docs, fix typos, or add missing content. See the
  [documentation conventions](/style-guide/documentation) in the style guide.
- **Report a bug** — if you've found an issue, open a GitHub issue with steps to reproduce it.
- **Propose a feature** — open an issue to discuss your idea before starting implementation.

**Tip:** Before working on a larger change, open an issue first to discuss your approach with the maintainers. This
avoids unnecessary work and helps align your contribution with the project's direction.

## Before You Contribute

Before writing code, make sure your contribution has a home in an issue. This keeps the discussion visible to
maintainers and other contributors and avoids duplicate or misaligned work.

- **Look for an existing issue** in the repository you want to contribute to. Someone may already be tracking the
  bug or feature you have in mind.
- **If nothing matches, open a new issue** in the corresponding project to describe the problem or idea. Use it to
  clarify open points and agree on an approach with the maintainers before starting implementation.
- **For larger or cross-cutting changes**, IronCore uses a central
  [enhancements repository](https://github.com/ironcore-dev/enhancements) where contributors submit
  **IronCore Enhancement Proposals (IEPs)**. An IEP is the place to describe the motivation, design, and trade-offs
  of a substantial idea or solution that affects one or more IronCore projects.
- **Even for an IEP, start with an issue.** Especially for new contributors, please open an issue in the
  enhancements repository first to outline the idea and gather early feedback. This makes it much easier for 
  maintainers to engage and for the proposal to land successfully.

## Making a Contribution

### Fork and Clone

Fork the repository you want to contribute to and clone it locally:

```shell
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/<repository>.git
cd <repository>
```

### Create a Branch

Create a feature branch from `main`:

```shell
git checkout -b my-feature
```

If needed, rebase to the current `main` before submitting your pull request:

```shell
git fetch upstream main
git rebase upstream/main
```

### Make Your Changes

- Follow the [coding](/style-guide/coding) and [documentation](/style-guide/documentation) style guides for code, testing, and documentation standards.
- Keep commits small and focused — each commit should be correct independently.
- Write clear [commit messages](/style-guide/coding#commit-messages) that explain *why*, not just *what*.
- Include tests for any new functionality or bug fix.
- Sign off every commit for DCO compliance:

```shell
git commit -s -m "Add support for feature X"
```

### Submit a Pull Request

Push your branch and open a pull request against `main`:

```shell
git push origin my-feature
```

In your pull request description:
- Explain what the change does and why it's needed.
- Reference any related issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
- Tag a relevant maintainer if you need a specific reviewer — check the `CODEOWNERS` file in the repository.

### Run Checks

Before submitting, run the project's checks locally to catch issues early. See
[Running tests](/style-guide/coding#running-tests) in the coding style guide for details:

```shell
make test          # Unit and integration tests
make lint          # Linter checks
make verify        # Code generation and manifests are up to date
```

## Code Review

All contributions go through code review before merging. Here's what to expect:

- **A maintainer will review your PR** and may request changes. This is normal — reviews improve code quality for
  everyone.
- **Address feedback** by pushing additional commits or amending existing ones.
- **Mark resolved comments** as resolved in GitHub and leave a comment when your changes are ready for another look.

Reviews are a collaborative process. Don't hesitate to ask questions or push back if you disagree with feedback —
respectful discussion leads to better outcomes.

## Reporting Issues

We use GitHub issues to track bugs and feature requests. When opening an issue:

- Check if a similar issue already exists.
- Provide enough context to understand and reproduce the problem.
- Use the issue templates provided in each repository when available.

## Licensing

All contributions to IronCore projects are licensed under the
[Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
